# 🔧 Code Formatter (Reusable Workflow)

This is a reusable GitHub Actions workflow that runs [MegaLinter](https://megalinter.io/) to automatically lint and format your codebase. It helps enforce consistent standards and can auto-correct issues.

This version uses the **Terraform flavor** of MegaLinter and does not currently support switching flavors.

To create pull requests with signed commits containing any fixes, you can chain this workflow with a separate [signed-commit reusable workflow](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-github-actions/tree/main/signed-commit).

---

## ✅ Features

- Powered by [MegaLinter](https://megalinter.io/), the all-in-one code linter and formatter
- Supports Terraform, YAML, JSON, and Markdown by default
- Pre-configured with optimized linters for Terraform repositories
- Uploads SARIF reports to GitHub Security tab for actionable insights
- Fully configurable via workflow inputs
- Automatically determines whether to lint all files or only changed ones

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Create a workflow file in your repository, for example `.github/workflows/format-code.yml`:

```yaml
name: Format Code

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, reopened, synchronize]

  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * 0" # Optional: runs weekly to lint whole codebase

permissions:
  contents: write
  security-events: write # needed for SARIF upload

jobs:
  format-code:
    uses: ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-github-actions/format-code@<ref>
    with:
      ignore_files: "README.md"

  commit-fixes:
    uses: ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-github-actions/signed-commit@<ref>
    with:
      github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      pr_title: "GitHub Actions Code Formatter workflow"
      pr_body: "This pull request includes updates from the GitHub Actions Code Formatter workflow. Please review the changes and merge if everything looks good."
```

> 🔁 Replace `<ref>` with a specific commit SHA or tag (e.g. `v1.0.0`) to ensure stability.

## 🧾 Inputs

These inputs let you fine-tune MegaLinter behaviour. All are optional with sensible defaults:

## 🧠 Codebase Validation Logic

By default, the `validate_all_codebase` behaviour is determined automatically:

- ✅ **Full codebase is scanned** when:
  - The event is `push` or `schedule`, **and**
  - The branch is `main`
- 🔁 **Only changed files are scanned** for other events (e.g., PRs to feature branches)

You can override this logic explicitly by setting the `validate_all_codebase` input to `true` or `false`.

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

- All actions are **pinned to full commit SHAs** for security and reproducibility
- SARIF output is uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- Uses GitHub’s `GITHUB_TOKEN` with the **principle of least privilege** encouraged

---

## 🛠 Customization

Although the workflow is optimized for Terraform-based repositories by default, you can override linters and inputs to tailor behaviour to your codebase. Example:

```yaml
with:
  enable_linters: "TERRAFORM_TERRAFORM_FMT,YAML_PRETTIER"
  ignore_files: ".terraform/*,README.md"
```

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome PRs for improvements, additional linters, updated docs, and bug fixes.
