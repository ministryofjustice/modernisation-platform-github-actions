# üîß Code Formatter (Reusable Workflow)

This is a reusable GitHub Actions workflow that runs [MegaLinter](https://megalinter.io/) to automatically lint and format your codebase. It helps enforce consistent standards and can auto-correct issues.

This workflow runs MegaLinter only. To create pull requests with signed commits containing any fixes, you can chain this workflow with a separate [signed-commit reusable workflow](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-github-actions/signed-commit).

---

## ‚úÖ Features

- Powered by [MegaLinter](https://megalinter.io/), the all-in-one code linter and formatter
- **Supports all major languages and formats**, including Terraform, Python, Markdown, JSON, YAML, etc.
- Uses [MegaLinter flavors](https://megalinter.io/flavors/) to optimise speed and relevance
- Fully configurable by consumers via inputs
- Uploads SARIF reports to GitHub Security tab for actionable insights

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

Create a workflow file in your repository, for example `.github/workflows/format-code.yml`:

```yaml
name: Format Code

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, reopened, synchronize]

permissions:
  contents: write
  security-events: write # needed for SARIF upload

jobs:
  format-code:
    uses: ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-github-actions/.github/workflows/format-code.yml@<ref>
    with:
      flavor: terraform
      ignore_files: "README.md"

  commit-fixes:
    uses: ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-github-actions/signed-commit@<ref>
    if: ${{ always() }}
    with:
      github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      pr_title: "GitHub Actions Code Formatter workflow"
      pr_body: "This pull request includes updates from the GitHub Actions Code Formatter workflow. Please review the changes and merge if everything looks good."
```

> üîÅ Replace <ref> with a specific commit SHA or tag (e.g. v1.0.0) to ensure stability.
> **Note:** This workflow only runs MegaLinter. To automatically create pull requests with fixes and signed commits, chain this with the [signed-commit reusable workflow](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-github-actions) as per above example.

## üß¨ MegaLinter Flavors

This workflow supports [MegaLinter Flavors](https://megalinter.io/flavors/) to optimise performance and relevance based on your codebase:

| Flavor      | Description                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `full`      | ‚úÖ Default ‚Äî runs all supported linters |
| `terraform` | Optimised for Terraform codebases       |
| `python`    | Optimised for Python projects           |
| `light`     | Minimal linters, fastest linting        |

Override the flavor by setting the `flavor` input:

```yaml
with:
  flavor: python
```

## üßæ Inputs

These inputs let you fine-tune behaviour. All are optional with sensible defaults:

> If `validate_all_codebase` is not provided, it defaults to `true` on `push` or `schedule` events to the `main` branch.  
> However, explicitly setting it to `"false"` disables full-codebase validation regardless of the event.

## üîê Security Notes

- All actions are **pinned to specific commit SHAs** for security and stability.
- SARIF output is uploaded to the GitHub Security tab for visibility into linting issues.
- Pull requests with signed commits should be created using the separate [signed commit workflow](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-github-actions).
- Uses GitHub's built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` for minimal-scoped auth.

## üõ† Example: Custom Python Setup

```yaml
